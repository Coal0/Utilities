Color Lookup Table
==================

A very basic color lookup table for the `256-color ANSI codes`_. At 41 lines of code, not my most spectacular project, but it's useful
as a quick reference.

The Table
---------

* 16 (0 - 15) standard and high intensity colors;

* 216 colors;

* 24 grayscale colors.
